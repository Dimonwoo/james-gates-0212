# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm James Gates.

I'm James, a Full-Time Full-Stack Freelance Developer ðŸ‘¨&zwj;ðŸ’» working remotely since 2022 ðŸš€

## About me
I was very interested in Web Application during my university period and the Library & Information Science made me as a Full Stack Developer. Web Application Development is not only my job, but also my life.

I can work full time, 8+ hours a day, 6 days a week.
I hope to work with you in a long time.
